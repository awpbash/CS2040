 *Create 2 priority queues, 1 for workstations 1 for researchers
We order the priority queue by the arrival time of the researcher
We order PQUEUE for workstation by the time it is done being used by researcher
then for every researcher, we check the PQUEUE workstation
if workstation PQUEUE is empty or the arrival time is < any end time of workstation, we need to unlock
Also check that the workstation will lock after y minutes so we can remove from PQUEUE once y minutes is up
Rinse and repeat YAY
