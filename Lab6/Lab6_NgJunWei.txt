Kattis Quest or sum shit
Idea 1, use a priority queue where higher energy higher priority followed by higher gold 

Idea 2:
TreeSet - no clue wtf it is but apparently is a bBST
 * We want to first find highest energy quest that can be done and if multiple have same energy, do highest gold
 * So we create a tree with custom comparator. First sorted by energy then gold
 * When query is called, we create a dummy quest worth current energy with super high gold and use it to compare with elements in the tree
 * 
 * Additionally, we NEED to store ID as we need to differentiate between duplicates. If we have quests with same energy and gold, we will lose the duplicates
 * and this will affect the final answer. i.e removing duplicated nodes WITHOUT ID will only remove 1 such node and not as many as possible fk u test case 5
* THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO STORE ID
