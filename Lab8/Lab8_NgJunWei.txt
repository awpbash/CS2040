/* Strat
 * Once we finish building the matrix, we scan through the matrix and whenever we find "L"
 * We run DFS. Since "C" can take any status, if "C" is connected to "L" then greedily we should treat it as "L"
 * So in our DFS, the stopping condition shld either be out of boundary OR we hit "W"
 * Instead of making a visited array, we can just change the ting to "W" to indicate visited
 * YEP then we DFS all 4 possible directions and when we stop DFS, we increment count by 1
 * If got no "L" at all then dont even bother DFS-ing all "C" can be "W" and we can just return 0
 * YEP
